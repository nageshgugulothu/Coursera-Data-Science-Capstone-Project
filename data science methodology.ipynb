This info should include personal data of the client and should include the ones that defaulted and the one that paid.\n\n3: Data Collection: We would use techiques like descriptive statistics and data evalution should be implemented in this phase to make sure that we have useful data for our model.\n\n4: Data Undestanding and Preparation: In this step we need to evaluate the different variables of our data in order to undestant it better. For example we would calculate univariate statistics, such as mean or median and the correlation between variables. So we need to evaluate the quality of the data. In the data preparation phase we have to prepare the data in an specific way depending on the model.\n\n5: Modeling and Evaluation: Lastly we create a classification model, evaluate the outcome and perform the corresponding changes untill we have a suitable model."
